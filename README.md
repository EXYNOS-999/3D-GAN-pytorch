# 3D GAN Pytorch
**Responsible** implementation of 3D-GAN NIPS 2016 paper that can be found https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6096-learning-a-probabilistic-latent-space-of-object-shapes-via-3d-generative-adversarial-modeling.pdf

We also included our **DCGAN** implementation since **3D-GAN** is the natural extension of DCGAN in 3D space. For completeness a Vanilla GAN is also included. All models all available in Google COLLAB. You can train them with the same training script that exists in train.py
